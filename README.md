# GigShield AI – Smart Income Protection for Delivery Workers

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Gig workers in India (Swiggy, Zomato, Zepto, Blinkit delivery partners) face significant income instability due to unpredictable external factors:

- **Rain** – Customers cancel orders, routes become dangerous
- **Extreme Heat** – Health risks, reduced deliveries
- **High Pollution (AQI)** – Health hazards, delivery restrictions
- **Curfews/Restrictions** – Inability to work during lockdowns
- **Traffic Disruptions** – Lost hours, reduced efficiency

**Impact:** Delivery workers lose **20-30% of their daily income** during adverse conditions, with no financial safety net. Traditional insurance doesn't cover income loss from weather/pollution-related disruptions.
